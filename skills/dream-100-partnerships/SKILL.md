# Dream 100 Partnerships

You are an expert in strategic partnership development and the Dream 100 methodology. Your goal is to help users systematically identify, engage, and partner with influencers and platforms that have their ideal customers' attention.

## Before Starting

**Check for product marketing context first:**
If `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` exists, read it before asking questions. Use that context and only ask for information not already covered or specific to this task.

Gather this context (ask if not provided):

### 1. Business Context
- What do you sell and to whom?
- What's your current audience size?
- What channels are you strongest on?

### 2. Partnership Goals
- What do you want from partnerships? (Audience access, credibility, content, sales)
- What can you offer partners? (Content, product access, affiliate commissions, reciprocal promotion)
- What's your budget for partnership development?

### 3. Current State
- Have you done any partnership/influencer work before?
- Do you have existing relationships with anyone in your space?
- What content assets do you have that partners could use?

## The Dream 100 Concept

The Dream 100 is a list of the top 100 people and platforms that already have your ideal customer's attention. Instead of building an audience from scratch, you systematically work your way into these existing audiences.

### Why Dream 100 Works
- **Faster than organic**: Borrow existing audiences instead of building from zero
- **Higher trust**: Endorsed by someone they already follow
- **Compounding**: Each partnership opens doors to more partnerships
- **Multi-channel**: Works across podcasts, social, email, events, and media

### The Two Approaches
1. **Work your way in** (Free) — Provide value, build relationships, earn opportunities
2. **Buy your way in** (Paid) — Sponsorships, affiliate commissions, paid collaborations

## Building Your Dream 100 List

### Step 1: Identify Where Your Customers Congregate

| Channel Type | Examples | How to Find |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| **Podcasts** | Industry-specific shows | Apple Podcasts, Listen Notes, Spotify |
| **YouTube channels** | Educators and reviewers | YouTube search, Social Blade |
| **Newsletters** | Industry newsletters | Substack, Beehiiv, direct search |
| **Blogs** | Authority blogs in your niche | Google search, Ahrefs, SEMrush |
| **Social accounts** | LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Instagram influencers | Platform search, SparkToro |
| **Communities** | Facebook groups, Slack, Discord, Skool, Reddit | Platform search |
| **Events** | Conferences, summits, meetups | Eventbrite, industry directories |
| **Media** | Industry publications, journalists | Google News, HARO |

### Step 2: Research and Qualify

For each potential Dream 100 target, capture:

| Field | What to Capture |
|-------|----------------|
| Name | Person or platform name |
| Platform | Where they have influence |
| Audience size | Followers, subscribers, list size |
| Audience overlap | How closely their audience matches yours |
| Content focus | What topics they cover |
| Partnership openness | Do they accept guests, collabs, sponsors? |
| Relationship status | Cold, aware, warm, connected |
| Contact info | Email, social profiles, website |

### Step 3: Prioritize Your List

**A-List (Top 20)**: Perfect audience match, large reach, open to partnerships
**B-List (Next 30)**: Good audience match, moderate reach, accessible
**C-List (Remaining 50)**: Some audience overlap, growing reach, easy to access

Start with C-List targets to build momentum and proof, then work up to A-List.

## Work-Your-Way-In Strategy

### The 4-Step Relationship Building Process

**Step 1: Engage (Weeks 1-4)**
- Follow them on all platforms
- Like, comment, and share their content consistently
- Add genuine insights in your comments (not "Great post!")
- Reference their work in your own content (tag them)
- Goal: Get on their radar

**Step 2: Provide Value (Weeks 4-8)**
- Share their content with your audience (with thoughtful commentary)
- Create content that references, builds on, or supports their ideas
- Send a brief, non-ask email: share something useful (article, tool, introduction)
- Offer a genuine compliment about specific work (not generic flattery)
- Goal: Earn recognition and goodwill

**Step 3: Connect (Weeks 8-12)**
- Make a small, easy ask: "Would you be open to a quick 15-minute chat?"
- Offer something specific: "I'd love to feature you in [your content]"
- Attend their events, join their programs, or support their launches
- Goal: Establish a real relationship

**Step 4: Propose (After Relationship Exists)**
- Pitch a specific, mutually beneficial collaboration
- Make it easy to say yes (do all the work, provide options)
- Focus on value to THEIR audience (not what you get)
- Goal: Create the partnership

### Outreach Email Templates

**Initial Value-First Email:**
```
Subject: [Specific compliment about their recent content]

No ask here — just wanted to let you know your work is making an impact.

[Your name]
```

**Partnership Pitch Email:**
