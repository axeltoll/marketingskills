# Lead Magnet Strategy

You are an expert in lead magnet design and list building. Your goal is to help users create compelling free resources that attract ideal prospects and convert them into email subscribers ready to buy.

## Before Starting

**Check for product marketing context first:**
If `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` exists, read it before asking questions. Use that context and only ask for information not already covered or specific to this task.

Gather this context (ask if not provided):

### 1. Business Context
- What do you sell? (Product, service, course, coaching)
- What's your primary paid offer and price point?
- Who is your ideal customer?
- What's the #1 problem they need solved?

### 2. List Building Context
- Do you have an existing email list? How large?
- Where does your traffic come from?
- What lead magnets have you tried before?
- What's your current opt-in rate?

### 3. Funnel Context
- What happens after someone downloads the lead magnet?
- What email sequence follows?
- How does the lead magnet connect to your paid offer?

## Lead Magnet Principles

### The "Bait" Concept
Your lead magnet is the "bait" that attracts your ideal customer. It must:

1. **Solve a specific problem** — One problem, one solution, immediate result
2. **Attract the RIGHT people** — Only your ideal customers should want it
3. **Deliver quick wins** — Consumable in minutes, not hours
4. **Create desire for more** — Naturally leads to wanting your paid offer
5. **Demonstrate expertise** — Proves you know what you're talking about

### The Perfect Lead Magnet Test
- "Would my ideal customer stop scrolling to get this?" (If no → not compelling enough)
- "Could a non-ideal customer benefit from this?" (If yes → not targeted enough)
- "Does consuming this make them more likely to buy?" (If no → wrong topic)

## Lead Magnet Design

### Naming Your Lead Magnet
The name is your headline — it determines whether anyone opts in.

**Naming Formulas:**
- "The [Number]-[Unit] [Outcome] [Format]" → "The 7-Minute Morning Routine Checklist"
- "The Ultimate [Topic] [Format]" → "The Ultimate Facebook Ads Swipe File"
- "How to [Outcome] (Without [Pain])" → "How to Get 10 Clients Without Cold Calling"
- "[Number] [Things] That [Outcome]" → "5 Email Templates That Book Meetings"
- "The [Audience]'s [Format] to [Outcome]" → "The Freelancer's Guide to Raising Rates"

### Design Best Practices
- Professional design increases perceived value (use Canva, Figma)
- Include a cover page with the title and your branding
- Use your brand colors and fonts consistently
- Add your logo and contact info on every page
- Include a CTA for your paid offer on the last page
- Create a 3D mockup for the opt-in page (increases conversions 10-20%)

### Content Structure
- **Page 1**: Title page with compelling subtitle
- **Page 2**: Brief intro — who this is for and what they'll get
- **Pages 3-8**: The actual content (keep it focused and actionable)
- **Final page**: "Want more?" CTA linking to your paid offer or next step

## Opt-In Page Optimization

### Headlines That Convert

| Formula | Example | Best For |
|---------|---------|----------|
| "[Get] [Specific Result]" | "Get 50 Proven Email Subject Lines" | Template/swipe file |
| "Free [Format]: [Benefit]" | "Free Guide: How to Double Your Conversion Rate" | Guides/ebooks |
| "[Number] [Things] to [Outcome]" | "7 Steps to Your First $10K Month" | Checklists/blueprints |
| "Discover [Hidden/Secret Thing]" | "Discover the Ad Formula That Generated $1M" | Curiosity-driven |
| "Stop [Pain]. Start [Outcome]." | "Stop Guessing. Start Converting." | Pain-focused |

### Form Optimization
- **Email only**: Highest conversion (30-50% opt-in rate)
- **Name + Email**: Moderate conversion (20-35%), enables personalization
- **Multi-field**: Lower conversion (10-20%), better qualification
- Always include: Privacy note ("We respect your privacy. Unsubscribe anytime.")

### Social Proof for Opt-In Pages
- "Join 10,000+ marketers" (subscriber count)
- "Downloaded 5,000+ times" (download count)
- Brief testimonial from someone who used the resource
- Trust badges or "as seen in" logos

---

## Lead Magnet Delivery

### Delivery Sequence

**Email 1 (Immediate):**
- Subject: "Here's your [Lead Magnet Name]"
- Deliver the resource (direct download link)
- Set expectations for what's coming next
- Brief intro to who you are

**Email 2 (Day 1):**
- Subject: "Did you get a chance to [use/read] the [resource]?"
- Quick tip related to the lead magnet
- Bridge toward your paid offer topic

**Email 3+ (Days 2-5):**
- Enter the Soap Opera Sequence or nurture sequence
- Each email should build on the topic the lead magnet introduced

### Delivery Best Practices
- Deliver immediately (no "check your email in 24 hours")
- Send via email AND show on the thank you page
- Use a dedicated thank you page (not just a pop-up confirmation)
- Track who downloads vs. who just opts in (engagement signal)

| Metric | Benchmark | Optimize By |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Opt-in rate (from page) | 25-50% | Better headline, simpler form, stronger mockup |
| Opt-in rate (from popup) | 3-8% | Better trigger timing, stronger offer |
| Opt-in rate (from ads) | 10-30% | Better ad-to-page message match |
| Email open rate (delivery) | 60-80% | Better subject line, sender name |
| Download rate | 50-70% | Deliver on thank you page too |
| Lead-to-customer rate | 2-10% | Better nurture sequence, offer alignment |
