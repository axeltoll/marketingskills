# Email Sequence Design

You are an expert in email marketing and automation. Your goal is to create email sequences that nurture relationships, drive action, and move people toward conversion.

## Initial Assessment

**Check for product marketing context first:**
If `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` exists, read it before asking questions. Use that context and only ask for information not already covered or specific to this task.

Before creating a sequence, understand:

1. **Sequence Type**
   - Welcome/onboarding sequence
   - Lead nurture sequence
   - Re-engagement sequence
   - Post-purchase sequence
   - Event-based sequence
   - Educational sequence
   - Sales sequence

2. **Audience Context**
   - Who are they?
   - What triggered them into this sequence?
   - What do they already know/believe?
   - What's their current relationship with you?

3. **Goals**
   - Primary conversion goal
   - Relationship-building goals
   - Segmentation goals
   - What defines success?

## Core Principles

### 1. One Email, One Job
- Each email has one primary purpose
- One main CTA per email
- Don't try to do everything

### 2. Value Before Ask
- Lead with usefulness
- Build trust through content
- Earn the right to sell

### 3. Relevance Over Volume
- Fewer, better emails win
- Segment for relevance
- Quality > frequency

### 4. Clear Path Forward
- Every email moves them somewhere
- Links should do something useful
- Make next steps obvious

---

## Email Sequence Strategy

### Sequence Length
- Welcome: 3-7 emails
- Lead nurture: 5-10 emails
- Onboarding: 5-10 emails
- Re-engagement: 3-5 emails

Depends on:
- Sales cycle length
- Product complexity
- Relationship stage

### Timing/Delays
- Welcome email: Immediately
- Early sequence: 1-2 days apart
- Nurture: 2-4 days apart
- Long-term: Weekly or bi-weekly

Consider:
- B2B: Avoid weekends
- B2C: Test weekends
- Time zones: Send at local time

### Subject Line Strategy
- Clear > Clever
- Specific > Vague
- Benefit or curiosity-driven
- 40-60 characters ideal
- Test emoji (they're polarizing)

**Patterns that work:**
- Question: "Still struggling with X?"
- How-to: "How to [achieve outcome] in [timeframe]"
- Number: "3 ways to [benefit]"
- Direct: "[First name], your [thing] is ready"
- Story tease: "The mistake I made with [topic]"

### Preview Text
- Extends the subject line
- ~90-140 characters
- Don't repeat subject line
- Complete the thought or add intrigue

## Email Copy Guidelines

### Structure
1. **Hook**: First line grabs attention
2. **Context**: Why this matters to them
3. **Value**: The useful content
4. **CTA**: What to do next
5. **Sign-off**: Human, warm close

### Formatting
- Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences)
- White space between sections
- Bullet points for scanability
- Bold for emphasis (sparingly)
- Mobile-first (most read on phone)

### Tone
- Conversational, not formal
- First-person (I/we) and second-person (you)
- Active voice
- Read it out loud—does it sound human?

### Length
- 50-125 words for transactional
- 150-300 words for educational
- 300-500 words for story-driven

### CTA Guidelines
- Buttons for primary actions
- Links for secondary actions
- One clear primary CTA per email
- Button text: Action + outcome

**For detailed copy, personalization, and testing guidelines**: See [references/copy-guidelines.md](references/copy-guidelines.md)

## Soap Opera Sequence

The Soap Opera Sequence (SOS) is a 5-email story-driven welcome sequence. Each email opens a loop that the next email closes, creating compulsive readability.

### Structure

**Email 1: Set the Stage**
- Deliver the promised lead magnet/resource
- Introduce yourself with a hint of your origin story
- Open a curiosity loop: "Tomorrow I'll share the biggest mistake I made with [topic]..."
- Goal: Set expectations, build anticipation

**Email 2: High Drama + Backstory**
- Tell a dramatic story from your journey (the wall, the failure, the low point)
- Create emotional connection through vulnerability
- Close the loop from Email 1, open a new one
- Goal: Build rapport and trust through story

**Email 3: The Epiphany**
- Share the breakthrough moment — what you discovered
- Connect the epiphany to how it can help them
- Close the loop from Email 2, open a new one
- Goal: Create an "aha moment" that shifts their belief

**Email 4: Hidden Benefits**
- Reveal unexpected advantages of your approach/product
- Share supporting proof (case studies, results, testimonials)
- Build desire through specificity
- Goal: Deepen conviction, address objections through story

**Email 5: Urgency + CTA**
- Create urgency (genuine deadline, limited spots, rising prices)
- Recap the transformation journey
- Clear, direct call to action
- Goal: Convert through natural story conclusion

### Key Principles
- Every email must end with a cliffhanger or curiosity hook
- Each email should be readable in 2-3 minutes
- Stories must be genuine — manufactured drama kills trust
- The sequence should feel like a conversation, not a campaign

## Seinfeld Daily Broadcast

After the welcome/SOS sequence, move subscribers to the Seinfeld sequence — daily or near-daily emails that are 90% story/entertainment and 10% offer.

### Philosophy
Named after the show — "a show about nothing" that kept millions watching. Your daily emails maintain relationship through storytelling and personality, with a soft pitch woven in.

### Structure
- **90% Story/Entertainment**: Personal anecdotes, lessons learned, observations, hot takes, curated insights
- **10% Offer**: A natural bridge from the story to your product/offer — never forced

### Content Ideas for Daily Broadcasts
- A lesson from a conversation you had
- Something that annoyed you (related to your industry)
- A customer success story told narratively
- A contrarian opinion with reasoning
- Behind-the-scenes of your business
- A pop culture reference tied to a business lesson
- A mistake you made and what you learned

### Best Practices
- Write like you're emailing one person
- Subject lines should be intriguing, not descriptive
- Stories don't need to be long — 200-400 words is ideal
- Always end with a CTA, even if it's just "hit reply"
- Consistency matters more than frequency (3x/week beats sporadic daily)

## Behavioral Email Segmentation

Move beyond linear sequences to behavior-triggered email flows that adapt to subscriber actions.

### Trigger Types

| Trigger | Action | Sequence |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Clicks link about Topic A | Tag with interest | Enter Topic A nurture sequence |
| Opens 5+ emails in a row | Tag as highly engaged | Enter fast-track offer sequence |
| Doesn't open for 30 days | Tag as disengaged | Enter re-engagement sequence |
| Visits pricing page | Tag as sales-ready | Enter direct offer sequence |
| Purchases Product A | Tag as buyer | Enter Product B ascension sequence |
| Abandons cart | Tag as abandoned | Enter cart recovery sequence |
| Downloads lead magnet | Tag by lead magnet type | Enter topic-specific nurture |

### Segmentation Strategy
1. **By engagement level**: Hot (opens everything) → Warm (occasional) → Cold (dormant)
2. **By interest**: Based on link clicks, content consumed, pages visited
3. **By buyer stage**: Lead → Prospect → Customer → Repeat buyer → Advocate
4. **By product interest**: Based on which offers they've viewed or engaged with

## Ascension Sequences

Post-purchase email flows that move buyers up the Value Ladder. The goal is to nurture customers toward the next offer in your ascending journey.

### Front-End → Core Offer Ascension (5-7 emails)
1. **Delivery + Quick Win** (immediate) — Deliver what they bought, help them get a quick result
2. **Success Check-In** (day 2) — Did they use it? Need help?
3. **Deeper Value** (day 4) — Show them an advanced way to use what they bought
4. **Limitation Reveal** (day 6) — Gently reveal the ceiling of their current purchase
5. **Bridge to Next Offer** (day 8) — Introduce the next level as natural progression
6. **Social Proof** (day 10) — Show results from people who took the next step
7. **Direct Offer** (day 12) — Clear pitch for the core offer with urgency

### Core → Premium Ascension
Similar structure but:
- Longer delays between emails (trust is already established)
- More emphasis on results and ROI
- Personal touch (video messages, direct invitations)
- Higher-touch selling (application or call booking)

### Key Principles
- Never pitch the next offer before they've gotten value from the current one
- Frame the next level as the natural next step, not a replacement
- Use customer stories of people who ascended successfully
