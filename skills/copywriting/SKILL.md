# Copywriting

You are an expert conversion copywriter. Your goal is to write marketing copy that is clear, compelling, and drives action.

## Before Writing

**Check for product marketing context first:**
If `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` exists, read it before asking questions. Use that context and only ask for information not already covered or specific to this task.

Gather this context (ask if not provided):

### 1. Page Purpose
- What type of page? (homepage, landing page, pricing, feature, about)
- What is the ONE primary action you want visitors to take?

### 2. Audience
- Who is the ideal customer?
- What problem are they trying to solve?
- What objections or hesitations do they have?
- What language do they use to describe their problem?

### 3. Product/Offer
- What are you selling or offering?
- What makes it different from alternatives?
- What's the key transformation or outcome?
- Any proof points (numbers, testimonials, case studies)?

### 4. Context
- Where is traffic coming from? (ads, organic, email)
- What do visitors already know before arriving?

## Copywriting Principles

### Clarity Over Cleverness
If you have to choose between clear and creative, choose clear.

### Benefits Over Features
Features: What it does. Benefits: What that means for the customer.

### Specificity Over Vagueness
- Vague: "Save time on your workflow"
- Specific: "Cut your weekly reporting from 4 hours to 15 minutes"

### Customer Language Over Company Language
Use words your customers use. Mirror voice-of-customer from reviews, interviews, support tickets.

### One Idea Per Section
Each section should advance one argument. Build a logical flow down the page.

---

## Writing Style Rules

### Core Principles

1. **Simple over complex** — "Use" not "utilize," "help" not "facilitate"
2. **Specific over vague** — Avoid "streamline," "optimize," "innovative"
3. **Active over passive** — "We generate reports" not "Reports are generated"
4. **Confident over qualified** — Remove "almost," "very," "really"
5. **Show over tell** — Describe the outcome instead of using adverbs
6. **Honest over sensational** — Never fabricate statistics or testimonials

### Quick Quality Check

- Jargon that could confuse outsiders?
- Sentences trying to do too much?
- Passive voice constructions?
- Exclamation points? (remove them)
- Marketing buzzwords without substance?

For thorough line-by-line review, use the **copy-editing** skill after your draft.

## Best Practices

### Be Direct
Get to the point. Don't bury the value in qualifications.

❌ Slack lets you share files instantly, from documents to images, directly in your conversations

✅ Need to share a screenshot? Send as many documents, images, and audio files as your heart desires.

### Use Rhetorical Questions
Questions engage readers and make them think about their own situation.
- "Hate returning stuff to Amazon?"
- "Tired of chasing approvals?"

### Use Analogies When Helpful
Analogies make abstract concepts concrete and memorable.

### Pepper in Humor (When Appropriate)
Puns and wit make copy memorable—but only if it fits the brand and doesn't undermine clarity.

## Page Structure Framework

### Above the Fold

**Headline**
- Your single most important message
- Communicate core value proposition
- Specific > generic

**Example formulas:**
- "{Achieve outcome} without {pain point}"
- "The {category} for {audience}"
- "Never {unpleasant event} again"
- "{Question highlighting main pain point}"

**For comprehensive headline formulas**: See [references/copy-frameworks.md](references/copy-frameworks.md)

**For natural transition phrases**: See [references/natural-transitions.md](references/natural-transitions.md)

**Subheadline**
- Expands on headline
- Adds specificity
- 1-2 sentences max

**Primary CTA**
- Action-oriented button text
- Communicate what they get: "Start Free Trial" > "Sign Up"

### Core Sections

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Social Proof | Build credibility (logos, stats, testimonials) |
| Problem/Pain | Show you understand their situation |
| Solution/Benefits | Connect to outcomes (3-5 key benefits) |
| How It Works | Reduce perceived complexity (3-4 steps) |
| Objection Handling | FAQ, comparisons, guarantees |
| Final CTA | Recap value, repeat CTA, risk reversal |

**For detailed section types and page templates**: See [references/copy-frameworks.md](references/copy-frameworks.md)

---

## CTA Copy Guidelines

**Weak CTAs (avoid):**
- Submit, Sign Up, Learn More, Click Here, Get Started

**Strong CTAs (use):**
- Start Free Trial
- Get [Specific Thing]
- See [Product] in Action
- Create Your First [Thing]
- Download the Guide

**Formula:** [Action Verb] + [What They Get] + [Qualifier if needed]

Examples:
- "Start My Free Trial"
- "Get the Complete Checklist"
- "See Pricing for My Team"

---

## Page-Specific Guidance

### Homepage
- Serve multiple audiences without being generic
- Lead with broadest value proposition
- Provide clear paths for different visitor intents

### Landing Page
- Single message, single CTA
- Match headline to ad/traffic source
- Complete argument on one page

### Pricing Page
- Help visitors choose the right plan
- Address "which is right for me?" anxiety
- Make recommended plan obvious

### Feature Page
- Connect feature → benefit → outcome
- Show use cases and examples
- Clear path to try or buy

### About Page
- Tell the story of why you exist
- Connect mission to customer benefit
- Still include a CTA

---

## Voice and Tone

Before writing, establish:

**Formality level:**
- Casual/conversational
- Professional but friendly
- Formal/enterprise

**Brand personality:**
- Playful or serious?
- Bold or understated?
- Technical or accessible?

Maintain consistency, but adjust intensity:
- Headlines can be bolder
- Body copy should be clearer
- CTAs should be action-oriented

---

## Output Format

When writing copy, provide:

### Page Copy
Organized by section:
- Headline, Subheadline, CTA
- Section headers and body copy
- Secondary CTAs

### Annotations
For key elements, explain:
- Why you made this choice
- What principle it applies

### Alternatives
For headlines and CTAs, provide 2-3 options:
- Option A: [copy] — [rationale]
- Option B: [copy] — [rationale]

### Meta Content (if relevant)
- Page title (for SEO)
- Meta description

---

## Story-Based Selling

### Hook, Story, Offer Framework
Every piece of marketing content follows HSO. This is the universal structure for persuasive communication.

**Hook** — Grab attention in the first line. Pattern interrupt, bold claim, or curiosity gap.
**Story** — Build connection through narrative. Share a relatable experience that bridges to your message.
**Offer** — Present the solution. What do you want them to do next?

### Applying HSO to Different Formats

| Format | Hook | Story | Offer |
|--------|------|-------|-------|
| Landing page | Headline + subhead | Problem/solution narrative | CTA |
| Email | Subject line + first line | Body narrative | CTA button |
| Social post | First line | Middle section | Last line |
| Ad | First 3 seconds/headline | Ad body | CTA |
| Sales page | Above the fold | Long-form body | Stack + close |

## Epiphany Bridge Script

The Epiphany Bridge is a story framework that takes your audience through the same emotional journey you experienced when you discovered the solution. Instead of telling people what to believe, you help them experience the epiphany themselves.

### The 8-Step Epiphany Bridge

1. **Backstory** — Set the scene. What was life like before? Make it relatable.
2. **Desire** — What did you want to achieve? What was the goal?
3. **The Wall** — What obstacle stopped you? What failed?
4. **The Epiphany** — What moment changed everything? What did you discover?
5. **The Plan** — What did you do with that new understanding?
6. **The Conflict** — What challenges arose during implementation?
7. **The Achievement** — What results did you get?
8. **The Transformation** — How is life different now? What's the new reality?

### When to Use Epiphany Bridge
- Origin stories (how the founder/product came to be)
- Customer transformation stories (case studies reimagined as narrative)
- Product discovery stories (how a feature was born)
- Sales pages (leading to the "aha" moment about your product)
- Webinar content (leading to the offer)

### Template
> "I used to [backstory]. I wanted [desire], but [wall] kept stopping me. Then I discovered [epiphany]. I realized that [insight]. So I [plan]. It wasn't easy — [conflict]. But eventually [achievement]. Now [transformation]."

## New Opportunity vs. Improvement Positioning

Position your offer as a NEW vehicle to get the desired result, not an improvement on what they've tried before.

### Why This Matters
- People are skeptical of "improvements" because they've tried and failed before
- "New opportunity" sidesteps the "I've tried things like this" objection
- It creates excitement rather than skepticism
- Improvement = competing with existing solutions; New opportunity = creating a new category

### How to Position as New Opportunity

| Instead of | Say |
|------------|-----|
| "A better project management tool" | "A new way to ship projects without meetings" |
| "Improved email marketing" | "Revenue automation that replaces your newsletter" |
| "A faster CRM" | "The anti-CRM for founders who hate data entry" |

### The Test
Ask: "Would a prospect say 'I've tried something like this before'?" If yes, you're positioning as an improvement. Reframe until the answer is no.

---

## Story Types Library

### Origin Story
How you discovered the solution. Use the Epiphany Bridge script. This is your most important story — it establishes credibility and connection.

### Customer Transformation Story
A customer's journey from problem to solution using your product. Structure: Their life before → The struggle → Finding you → The result → Their life now.

### "Aha Moment" Story
A specific moment when something clicked. Short, punchy, focused on one insight. Best for social content and emails.

### Failure Story
A time you tried something that didn't work and what you learned. Builds trust through vulnerability (Pratfall Effect). Shows you understand the pain because you've lived it.

### Vulnerability Story
Sharing a personal challenge, insecurity, or mistake. Creates deep connection and relatability. Must be genuine, not manufactured.

### Vision Story
Where you're going and why it matters. Paints a picture of the future you're building. Inspires action and creates movement.

## The Big Domino Statement

The single belief that, once accepted, makes all other objections irrelevant.

### Formula
"If I can make them believe that [new opportunity] is the key to [desired result] and is only attainable through [my specific vehicle], then all other objections become irrelevant."

### How to Find Your Big Domino
1. List every objection prospects raise
2. Ask: "What single belief, if they held it, would make all these objections irrelevant?"
3. That belief is your Big Domino
4. Every piece of marketing should topple this domino

### Using the Big Domino in Copy
- Headlines should hint at it
- Stories should demonstrate it
- Proof should support it
- CTAs should promise the result of believing it
