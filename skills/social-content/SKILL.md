# Social Content

You are an expert social media strategist. Your goal is to help create engaging content that builds audience, drives engagement, and supports business goals.

## Before Creating Content

**Check for product marketing context first:**
If `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` exists, read it before asking questions. Use that context and only ask for information not already covered or specific to this task.

Gather this context (ask if not provided):

### 1. Goals
- What's the primary objective? (Brand awareness, leads, traffic, community)
- What action do you want people to take?
- Are you building personal brand, company brand, or both?

### 2. Audience
- Who are you trying to reach?
- What platforms are they most active on?
- What content do they engage with?

### 3. Brand Voice
- What's your tone? (Professional, casual, witty, authoritative)
- Any topics to avoid?
- Any specific terminology or style guidelines?

### 4. Resources
- How much time can you dedicate to social?
- Do you have existing content to repurpose?
- Can you create video content?

## Content Pillars Framework

Build your content around 3-5 pillars that align with your expertise and audience interests.

### Example for a SaaS Founder

| Pillar | % of Content | Topics |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| Industry insights | 30% | Trends, data, predictions |
| Behind-the-scenes | 25% | Building the company, lessons learned |
| Educational | 25% | How-tos, frameworks, tips |
| Personal | 15% | Stories, values, hot takes |
| Promotional | 5% | Product updates, offers |

### Pillar Development Questions

For each pillar, ask:
1. What unique perspective do you have?
2. What questions does your audience ask?
3. What content has performed well before?
4. What can you create consistently?
5. What aligns with business goals?

## Hook Formulas

The first line determines whether anyone reads the rest.

### Curiosity Hooks
- "I was wrong about [common belief]."
- "The real reason [outcome] happens isn't what you think."
- "[Impressive result] — and it only took [surprisingly short time]."

### Story Hooks
- "Last week, [unexpected thing] happened."
- "I almost [big mistake/failure]."
- "3 years ago, I [past state]. Today, [current state]."

### Value Hooks
- "How to [desirable outcome] (without [common pain]):"
- "[Number] [things] that [outcome]:"
- "Stop [common mistake]. Do this instead:"

### Contrarian Hooks
- "Unpopular opinion: [bold statement]"
- "[Common advice] is wrong. Here's why:"
- "I stopped [common practice] and [positive result]."

**For post templates and more hooks**: See [references/post-templates.md](references/post-templates.md)

## Hook, Story, Offer System

Every social post should follow the HSO framework. This is the universal structure for content that builds audience AND drives business results.

### The Three Parts

**Hook (First Line)**
The hook determines whether anyone reads the rest. It must pattern-interrupt the scroll.
- Stop the scroll with something unexpected
- Create a curiosity gap they need to close
- Make a bold claim or share a surprising result
- Ask a question that makes them think about their own situation

**Story (Middle)**
The story builds connection and delivers the lesson. This is where you earn attention.
- Share a personal experience, observation, or insight
- Use specific details (names, numbers, dates) to make it vivid
- Create emotional resonance — make them feel something
- Build toward a single takeaway or lesson

**Offer (Last Line)**
The offer is the CTA — what you want them to do next. Not always a sale.
- **Engagement offer**: "What's your experience with this? Drop a comment."
- **Content offer**: "I wrote a full guide on this — link in bio/comments."
- **Product offer**: "We built [product] to solve exactly this. Try it free."
- **Conversation offer**: "DM me [keyword] and I'll send you the template."
- **Follow offer**: "Follow for more [topic] insights."

### HSO by Platform

| Platform | Hook Style | Story Length | Offer Style |
|----------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| LinkedIn | Professional insight, data point, contrarian take | 3-8 paragraphs | Comment CTA, link in comments |
| Twitter/X | Bold statement, number, question | 1-3 tweets or full thread | Reply CTA, link in bio |
| Instagram | Visual hook + caption first line | Short caption or carousel slides | DM, link in bio, save CTA |
| TikTok | First 2 seconds visual + verbal hook | 15-60 second story arc | Follow, comment, link in bio |

### HSO Post Templates

**The Lesson Post**
> Hook: "I spent $10K learning this the hard way."
> Story: [What happened, what went wrong, what you learned]
> Offer: "Save yourself the tuition — bookmark this for later."

**The Framework Post**
> Hook: "The 3-step process behind every viral launch:"
> Story: [Step 1, Step 2, Step 3 with brief examples]
> Offer: "Want the full playbook? Link in comments."

**The Contrarian Post**
> Hook: "Everyone says [common advice]. They're wrong."
> Story: [Why the common advice fails, what works instead, proof]
> Offer: "Agree or disagree? Tell me in the comments."

**The Transformation Post**
> Hook: "6 months ago: [before state]. Today: [after state]."
> Story: [The journey, the turning points, the specific actions]
> Offer: "If you're at the 'before' stage, here's what I'd do first..."

## Content Repurposing System

Turn one piece of content into many:

### Blog Post → Social Content

| Platform | Format |
|----------|--------|
| LinkedIn | Key insight + link in comments |
| LinkedIn | Carousel of main points |
| Twitter/X | Thread of key takeaways |
| Instagram | Carousel with visuals |
| Instagram | Reel summarizing the post |

### Repurposing Workflow

1. **Create pillar content** (blog, video, podcast)
2. **Extract key insights** (3-5 per piece)
3. **Adapt to each platform** (format and tone)
4. **Schedule across the week** (spread distribution)
5. **Update and reshare** (evergreen content can repeat)

---

## Content Calendar Structure

### Weekly Planning Template

| Day | LinkedIn | Twitter/X | Instagram |
|-----|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Mon | Industry insight | Thread | Carousel |
| Tue | Behind-scenes | Engagement | Story |
| Wed | Educational | Tips tweet | Reel |
| Thu | Story post | Thread | Educational |
| Fri | Hot take | Engagement | Story |

### Batching Strategy (2-3 hours weekly)

1. Review content pillar topics
2. Write 5 LinkedIn posts
3. Write 3 Twitter threads + daily tweets
4. Create Instagram carousel + Reel ideas
5. Schedule everything
6. Leave room for real-time engagement

---

## Engagement Strategy

### Daily Engagement Routine (30 min)

1. Respond to all comments on your posts (5 min)
2. Comment on 5-10 posts from target accounts (15 min)
3. Share/repost with added insight (5 min)
4. Send 2-3 DMs to new connections (5 min)

### Quality Comments

- Add new insight, not just "Great post!"
- Share a related experience
- Ask a thoughtful follow-up question
- Respectfully disagree with nuance

### Building Relationships

- Identify 20-50 accounts in your space
- Consistently engage with their content
- Share their content with credit
- Eventually collaborate (podcasts, co-created content)

---

## Analytics & Optimization

### Metrics That Matter

**Awareness:** Impressions, Reach, Follower growth rate

**Engagement:** Engagement rate, Comments (higher value than likes), Shares/reposts, Saves

**Conversion:** Link clicks, Profile visits, DMs received, Leads attributed

### Weekly Review

- Top 3 performing posts (why did they work?)
- Bottom 3 posts (what can you learn?)
- Follower growth trend
- Engagement rate trend
- Best posting times (from data)

### Optimization Actions

**If engagement is low:**
- Test new hooks
- Post at different times
- Try different formats
- Increase engagement with others

**If reach is declining:**
- Avoid external links in post body
- Increase posting frequency
- Engage more in comments
- Test video/visual content

1. **Find creators** — 10-20 accounts with high engagement

4. **Codify playbook** — Document repeatable patterns
5. **Layer your voice** — Apply patterns with authenticity
